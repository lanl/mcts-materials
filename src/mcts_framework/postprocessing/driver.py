"""
One generic driver that regenerates a study's outputs from a finished run.

A "study" in the framework is just an MCTS run directory: `mcts-run run` writes
config.yaml (the run's own parameters) and tree.json (the explored tree) into it,
alongside the summary/CSV files. This driver reads those two artifacts back and
produces the publication outputs - the top-N LaTeX table, the E_hull-vs-rDOS
scatter, and the radial search tree - all keyed off the run's own config, so
there is no per-study script and no duplicated parameters. Point it at any run
directory and it reproduces that run's figures.
